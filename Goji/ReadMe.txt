Java Test - Social media message system

You have been tasked with building part of a simple social media system which will allow people to publish messages and for their friends to recommend them.

Provide an interface and concrete implementation with the following functionality:

    • Record a user sending a message
    • Allow a user to recommend a message
    • Return all messages sent by a user
    • Return all users who have recommended a message
    • Return the message published by a user which has been recommended the most

You are not required to implement a GUI (or CLI) or persistent storage. You may use any appropriate libraries to help, but do not include the jars or class files in your submission.
